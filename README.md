A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R,
including the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org), docker-compose,
and env files.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub

thee meetup.
