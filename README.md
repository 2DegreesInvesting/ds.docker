A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R.

## Why is this important?

In order to develop and use the research software you work with you need
to install and update software frequently. You can’t reproduce a bug or
analysis unless you have the specific software that bug or analysis
depends on, for example, Ubuntu 18.04, R &gt;= 3.4, and dplyr &gt;= 1.0.

With Docker you can use “mini computers”, some of which are specifically
designed for data science with R and come pre-installed with popular
software such as Rstudio and the tidyverse.

This series will help you do things like these:

-   Use a Unix terminal, even if you are on Windows.
-   Use the latest version of R and R packages, without updating your
    own system.
-   Reproduce a problem you see with an older version of R.
-   Reproduce a problem you see with the development version of R.
-   Use RStudio from the web browser, even if it’s not installed on your
    computer.
-   Share your computing environment with others so they can reproduce
    your analysis.

## Syllabus

This syllabus is flexible and will adapt based on people’s need. The
goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R,
including the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org), docker-compose,
and env files.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.shiny/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Getting started and Rocker images
