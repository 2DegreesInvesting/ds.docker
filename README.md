A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R,
including the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org), docker-compose,
and env files.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.shiny/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Getting started with the Rocker project

This meetup introduces the Rocker project. It covers [Getting
started](https://www.rocker-project.org/) and
[volumes](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/shared_volumes/).

Objectives:

-   Run R in a docker container.
-   Run RStudio in a docker container and access it from the web
    browser.
-   Share a volume between the host computer and the Docker container.

## Next

-   `docker-compose`.
-   env files.
-   [Managing
    containers](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_containers/).
-   [Managing users](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_users/)
