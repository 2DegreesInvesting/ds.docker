A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R,
with a focus on the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org) project.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   [ ] Use a Unix terminal, even if you are on Windows.
-   [ ] Use the latest version of R and R packages, without updating
    your own system.
-   [ ] Reproduce a problem you see with an older version of R.
-   [ ] Reproduce a problem you see with the development version of R.
-   [ ] Use RStudio from the web browser, even if itâ€™s not installed on
    your computer.
-   [ ] Share your computing environment with others so they can
    reproduce your analysis.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Getting started with the Rocker project

This meetup introduces the Rocker project. It covers [Getting
started](https://www.rocker-project.org/) and
[volumes](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/shared_volumes/).

Objectives:

-   Run R in a docker container.
-   Run RStudio in a docker container and access it from the web
    browser.
-   Share a volume between the host computer and the Docker container.

## Next

-   `docker-compose`.
-   env files.
-   [Managing
    containers](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_containers/).
-   [Managing users](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_users/)
