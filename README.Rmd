A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R. 

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R, including
the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org), docker-compose, and env files.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.shiny/releases) that preserves
a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during thee meetup.

## An overview of the Rocker project

This meetup introduces the Rocker project. It covers [Getting
started](https://www.rocker-project.org/), an overview of
[images](https://www.rocker-project.org/images/) and
[volumes](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/shared_volumes/).

## Next
