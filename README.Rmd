A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R. 

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R, with a
focus on the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org) project.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

- [ ] Use a Unix terminal, even if you are on Windows.
- [ ] Use the latest version of R and R packages, without updating your own
system.
- [ ] Reproduce a problem you see with an older version of R.
- [ ] Reproduce a problem you see with the development version of R.
- [ ] Use RStudio from the web browser, even if it’s not installed on your
computer.
- [ ] Share your computing environment with others so they can reproduce your
analysis.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during thee
meetup.

## Getting started with the Rocker project

This meetup introduces the Rocker project. It covers [Getting
started](https://www.rocker-project.org/) and
[volumes](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/shared_volumes/).

Objectives:

* Run R in a docker container.
* Run RStudio in a docker container and access it from the web browser.
* Share a volume between the host computer and the Docker container.

## Next

* `docker-compose`.
* env files.
* [Managing containers](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_containers/).
* [Managing users](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_users/)

## Resources

* [Audience and
importance](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/74).
* [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
* [The Rocker project](https://www.rocker-project.org/).
* [Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).
