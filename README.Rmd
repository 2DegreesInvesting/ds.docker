A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R. 

## Why is this important?

In order to develop and use the research software you work with you need to
install and update software frequently. You can't reproduce a bug or analysis
unless you have the specific software that bug or analysis depends on, for
example, Ubuntu 18.04, R >= 3.4, and dplyr >= 1.0.

With Docker you can use "mini computers", some of which are specifically
designed for data science with R and come pre-installed with popular software
such as Rstudio and the tidyverse.

This  series will help you do things like these:

* Use a Unix terminal, even if you are on Windows.
* Use the latest version of R and R packages, without updating your own system.
* Reproduce a problem you see with an older version of R.
* Reproduce a problem you see with the development version of R.
* Use RStudio from the web browser, even if itâ€™s not installed on your computer.
* Share your computing environment with others so they can reproduce your analysis.

## Syllabus

This syllabus is flexible and will adapt based on people's need. The goal is to
lean how to use Docker images for data science with R, including the
[Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org), docker-compose, and env files.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.shiny/releases) that preserves
a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during thee meetup.

## Getting started and Rocker images

* [Getting started](https://www.rocker-project.org/).
