A series of meetups about using Docker for data science with R. 

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use Docker images for data science with R. The focus
is not on building your own Docker images but instead on using existing images
-- particularly those from the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org) project.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

- [ ] Use a Unix terminal, even if you are on Windows.
- [ ] Use the latest version of R and R packages, without updating your own
system.
- [ ] Reproduce a problem you see with an older version of R.
- [ ] Reproduce a problem you see with the development version of R.
- [x] Use RStudio from the web browser, even if itâ€™s not installed on your
computer.
- [ ] Share your computing environment with others so they can reproduce your
analysis.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during thee
meetup.

## Getting started with the Rocker project

This meetup introduces the Rocker project. It covers [Getting
started](https://www.rocker-project.org/) and
[volumes](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/shared_volumes/).

Objectives:

* Run R in a docker container.
* Run RStudio in a docker container and access it from the web browser.
* Share a volume between the host computer and the Docker container.

## `docker-compose` and .env files.

`docker-compose` is a tool used to organize and simplify running Docker
containers. This sessions will cover basic usage of `docker-compose` to specify
options, and provide a consistent command for working with Docker. We will also
cover the use of .env files for storing secure secrets.

## Next (TBC)

* [Managing containers](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_containers/).
* [Managing users](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/managing_users/)

## Resources

* [Audience and
importance](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/74).
* [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
* [The Rocker project](https://www.rocker-project.org/).
* [Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/).
