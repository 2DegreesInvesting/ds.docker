# [Getting started with the Rocker project](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker#getting-started-with-the-rocker-project)

This document shows how to find the information you need to learn Docker from
examples in the wild.

## [Run R inside a container](https://www.rocker-project.org/):

```bash
docker run --rm -ti rocker/r-base
```

## [Reference for `docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

* [General form](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#general-form)

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

Note `docker run` are obligatory; the rest are optional:

* `--rm`

> By default a container's file system persists even after the container exits. ... If instead youâ€™d like Docker to automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits, you can add the --rm flag.
-- https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm

* `-ti`

> For interactive processes (like a shell), you must use -i -t together ... often written -it.
